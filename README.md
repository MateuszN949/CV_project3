To run the models we strongly recommend uploading them to Google Colaboratory and using one of their GPUâ€™s. This will require you to have a Kaggle account and generate a token in your profile section, to validate downloading of the set. This way it is not needed to download the set by yourself, nor install the libraries. In case you really want to run the programs on your own computer it will require you to do these things, but also to properly set up your directories and change the programs to get the data from your device.

Running the models should take 30-120 minutes, depending on the GPU, but mind that it also requires a sufficient memory.
